Quick Performance Test Results
------------------------------

Protocol Parsing:
- GET parsing: 1,612,784 ops/sec (0.001 ms/op)
- SET parsing: 1,027,833 ops/sec (0.001 ms/op)
- ZADD (5 members) parsing: 357,961 ops/sec (0.003 ms/op)
- SET (1KB value) parsing: 38,370 ops/sec (0.026 ms/op)

Storage Operations:
- SET storage: 129,630 ops/sec (0.007 ms/op)
- GET storage: 490,677 ops/sec (0.002 ms/op)

Analysis Notes:
--------------

1. Protocol Parsing Bottlenecks:
   - GET command: Fast but still allocates 3 strings (command, key, result)
   - SET command: Slower due to value string allocation
   - ZADD command: Much slower due to parsing multiple score-member pairs
   - Large payloads: Significant slowdown with 1KB values

2. Storage Layer Performance:
   - GET is 3.8x faster than SET
   - Both limited by bincode serialization
   - RocksDB overhead is acceptable

3. Memory Allocation Hotspots:
   - Request::parse() allocates for every whitespace split
   - DataType serialization clones entire structures
   - No object pooling or arena allocation

4. Data Structure Issues:
   - Lists: Vec<String> with O(n) front insertion
   - Sets: HashSet re-hashing on growth
   - SortedSets: Full sort on every ZRANGE query
   - JSON: Double serialization (JSON → String → Bincode)

5. Estimated Python Client Performance:
   - Network overhead: ~0.1-0.2ms per request
   - Total SET: ~10-15K ops/sec
   - Total GET: ~15-20K ops/sec

Optimization Opportunities:
-------------------------

1. Zero-copy protocol parsing: 3-5x improvement
2. Arena allocation: 50% reduction in allocation overhead  
3. Optimized data structures: 2-4x for list/zset operations
4. Direct serialization: 2x improvement for JSON

Expected Overall Improvement: 2.5-4x throughput with C/C++ optimizations
